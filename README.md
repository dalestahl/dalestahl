# About me

I study the history of water, energy, and society in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. 
Iâ€™m currently finishing a book about the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in the twentieth century. The book tells the story of how ecological change interacted with water management and dam building. Stanford University Press plans to publish the book in late 2025 or early 2026.
