# About me

I study the history of water, energy, and society in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. 
Iâ€™m currently finishing a book about the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and how ecological change interacted with water management and dam building. The book will be published by Stanford University Press in late 2025.
